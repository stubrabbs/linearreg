Contains the function "linearreg" which produces estimates and related inferences for any user-specified outcome and predictors. The outcome must be provided in the form of a vector of outcomes, and the predictors must be provided in the form of a matrix whose columns are the values of one predictor for each corresponding outcome (user does not need to include an intercept column). (See documentation for more details on necessary input). Output will include parameter estimates and standard errors, t test results for individual parameters, R squared values for the full model and adjusted R squared values if it is a multiple linear regresion, and F test results for the full model.
